# Firebase Hosting Playground

## Step by step:

- create your flutter project
- put it in a Github repository
- install the firebase cli
- run "firebase login" to sync the cli with your Google account
- run "firebase init" in your project root
- select the Hosting feature and the others tha you'll use
- create or use an existing project

And when asked, answer the following questions like this:


- What do you want to use as your public directory? build/web
- Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? Yes
- Set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub? Yes


Your Firebase Hosting will work.

Now, edit the Github Workflow Files like in this project, to your CI/CD work.
